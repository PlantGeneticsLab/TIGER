#PopDep is used to perform perform depth profiling in a population, based on media/high depth (e.g. >5X) whole genome sequencing data. They are useful to identify conserved regions of a genome.
#It outputs 2 statistics, 
#Mean depth of all taxa at a specific site
#SD of depth of all taxa
#To run and pipeline, the machine should have both Java 8 and samtools installed. The lib directory should stay with TIGER.jar in the same folder.
#Command line example is as follows,
#java -Xmx100g -jar TIGER.jar -a PopDep -p parameter_popdep.txt > log.txt &
#To specify options, please edit the the parameters below. Also, please keep the order of parameters.

#Parameter 1: The taxaRefBamMap file containing information of taxon and its corresponding bam files. The bam file should have .bai file in the same folder
#If one taxon has n bam files, please list them in n rows.

#Parameter 2: The chromosome which will be scanned.
1

#Parameter 3: The length of the chromosome
1000000

#Parameter 4: The path of samtools
/usr/local/bin/samtools

#Parameter 5: Number of threads

#Parameter 6: The output file in gz format
