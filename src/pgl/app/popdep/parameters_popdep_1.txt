@Step:	1

#PopDep is used to perform perform depth profiling in a population, based on media/high depth (e.g. >5X) whole genome sequencing data. They are useful to identify conserved regions of a genome.
#It outputs 4 statistics, 
#Mean depth of all taxa at a specific site
#SD of depth of all taxa
#Mean of standardized depth (relative to single copy regions)
#SD of standardized depth across taxa.
#To run and pipeline, the machine should have both Java 8 and samtools installed. The lib directory should stay with TIGER.jar in the same folder.
#It has 2 steps, the first is to identify depth mode of all taxa, the second is to output depth statistics described above.
#Command line example for step 1,
#java -Xmx100g -jar TIGER.jar -a PopDep -p parameter_popdep_1.txt > log.txt &
#Command line example for step 2,
#java -Xmx100g -jar TIGER.jar -a PopDep -p parameter_popdep_2.txt > log.txt &
#This file is the parameter file of step 1.
#To specify options, please edit the the parameters below. Also, please keep the order of parameters.

#Parameter 1: The taxaRefBam file containing information of taxon and its corresponding bam files. The bam file should have .bai file in the same folder
/Users/feilu/Documents/analysisL/softwareTest/pgl/popdep/inputfile/taxaRefBam.txt

#Parameter 2: The taxaDepthMode file containing information of taxon and its corresponding depth mode across bam files.
#Make sure this file is writable
/Users/feilu/Documents/analysisL/softwareTest/pgl/popdep/inputfile/taxaDepthMode.txt

#Parameter 3: The chromosome length file
/Users/feilu/Documents/analysisL/softwareTest/pgl/popdep/inputfile/chromosomeLength.txt

#Parameter 4: The path of samtools
/usr/local/bin/samtools

#Parameter 5: Number of threads
16
