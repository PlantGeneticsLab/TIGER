#This program is used to genotype whole genome sequenced (WGS) individuals by scanning an existing haplotype library.
#The usage is java -Xms10g -Xmx20g -jar HapScanner.jar parameters_hapScanner.txt > log.txt &
#Please keep the order of following parameters.
#Note: Only integers can be recegonized for Chr.
#The taxaRefBam file containing information of taxon and its corresponding refernece genome and bam files. The bam file should have .bai file in the same folder

#The posAllele file (with header), the format is Chr\tPos\tRef\tAlt (from VCF format). The positions come from haplotype library.

#The pos files (without header), the format is Chr\tPos. The positions come from haplotype library, which is used in mpileup.

#Combined error rate of sequencing and misalignment. Heterozygous read mapping are more likely to be genotyped as homozygote when the combined error rate is high.
