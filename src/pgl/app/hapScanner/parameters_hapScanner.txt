#HapScanner is used to perform genotyping of diploid species from whole genome sequenceing data, based on an existing haplotype library.
#To run and pipeline, the machine should have both Java 8 and samtools installed. The lib directory should stay with TIGER.jar in the same folder.
#Command line example. java -Xmx100g -jar TIGER.jar -a HapScanner -p parameter_hapscanner.txt > log.txt &
#To specify options, please edit the the parameters below. Also, please keep the order of parameters.

#Parameter 1: The taxaRefBam file containing information of taxon and its corresponding refernece genome and bam files. The bam file should have .bai file in the same folder
#If one taxon has n bam files, please list them in n rows.

#Parameter 2: The posAllele file (with header), the format is Chr\tPos\tRef\tAlt (from VCF format). The positions come from haplotype library. 
#A maximum of 2 alternative alleles are supported, which is seperated by ",", e.g. A,C.
#Deletion and insertion are supported, denoted as "D" and "I".

#Parameter 3: The pos files (without header), the format is Chr\tPos. The positions come from haplotype library, which is used in mpileup.

#Parameter 4: The chromosome which will be scanned.
1

#Parameter 5: Combined error rate of sequencing and misalignment. Heterozygous read mapping are more likely to be genotyped as homozygote when the combined error rate is high.
0.05

#Parameter 6: The path of samtools
/usr/local/bin/samtools

#Parameter 7: Number of threads
16

#Parameter 8: The directory of output
