@Step:	1

#FastCall2 is designed to perform SNP calling and genotyping of diploid ourcrossing/incrossing species, based on whole-genome sequencing data.
#Different form FastCall, FastCall2 performs individual genetic variation discovery first (step 1), then build a genetic variation library of all individuals (step 2), then do genotyping by combining all the individual genotype file into a final VCF (step 3).
#To run and pipeline, the machine should have both Java 8 and samtools installed. The lib directory should stay with TIGER.jar in the same folder.
#Command line example. java -Xmx100g -jar TIGER.jar -a FastCall2 -p parameter_fastcall2_1.txt > log.txt &
#To specify options, please edit the the parameters below. Also, please keep the order of parameters.

#Parameter 1:	Reference genome file with an index file (.fai). The reference should be in Fasta format. Chromosomes are labelled as numbers (1,2,3,4,5...). It is recommended to use reference chromosome while perform variation discovery for each chromosome because loading reference genome would be much faster.

#Parameter 2:	The taxaBamMap file contains information of taxon and its corresponding bam files. The bam file should have .bai file in the same folder.

#Parameter 3:	Minimum mapping quality (MQ) for an alignment to be used for variation calling. It is 30 by default.
30

#Parameter 4:	Minimum base quality (BQ) for a base to be used for variation calling. It is 20 by default.
20

#Parameter 5:	Minimum read depth count (MDC) for variation calling, meaning that sites with depth lower than the minimum will not be taken into account for variation discovery. It is 2 by default.
2

#Parameter 6:	Minimum read depth ratio (MiDR) for variation calling, meaning that sites with depth lower than the MiDR of the individual sequencing coverage will not be considered for variation discovery. It is 0.2 by default.
0.2

#Parameter 7:	Maximum read depth ratio (MaDR) for variation calling, meaning that sites with depth higher than the MaDR of the individual sequencing coverage will not be considered for variation discovery. It is 3 by default.
3

#Parameter 8:	Homozygous ratio (HoR) for variation calling, meaning that the depth of alternative allele is greater than HoR are considered to homozygous. It is 0.8 by default.
0.8

#Parameter 9:	Heterozygous ratio (HeR) for variation calling, meaning that the depth of alternative allele is greater than HeR and less than (1-HeR) are considered to be hets. It is 0.35 by default.
0.35

#Parameter 10:	Third allele depth ratio (TDR) for variation calling. If the depth of the third allele is greater than TDR by the individual coverage, the site will be ignored. Otherwise, the third allele will be considered as sequencing error. It is 0.2 by default.
0.2

#Parameter 11:	Chromosome or region on which genotyping will be performed (e.g. chromosome 1 is designated as 1. Region 1bp to 100000bp on chromosome 1 is 1:1,100000)
1:1,200000

#Parameter 12:	Number of threads (taxa number to be processed at the same time). It is 32 by default.
32

#Parameter 13:	Individual genotype output directory.

#Parameter 14: The path of samtools.
/usr/local/bin/samtools
