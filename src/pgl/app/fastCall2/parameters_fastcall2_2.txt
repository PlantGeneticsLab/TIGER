#FastCall2 is designed to perform SNP calling and genotyping of diploid ourcrossing/incrossing species, based on whole-genome sequencing data.
#Different form FastCall, FastCall2 performs individual genetic variation discovery first (step 1), then do genotyping by combining all the individual genotype file into a final VCF (step 2).
#To run and pipeline, the machine should have both Java 8 and samtools installed. The lib directory should stay with TIGER.jar in the same folder.
#Command line example. java -Xmx100g -jar TIGER.jar -a FastCall2 -p parameter_fastcall2_1.txt > log.txt &
#To specify options, please edit the the parameters below. Also, please keep the order of parameters. 

#Parameter 1:	Reference genome file with an index file (.fai). The reference should be in Fasta format. Chromosomes are labled as 1-based numbers (1,2,3,4,5...).
/Users/feilu/Documents/analysisL/softwareTest/pgl/fastCall/ref/chr001_1Mb.fa

#Parameter 2:	Chromosome or region on which genotyping will be performed (e.g. chromosome 1 is designated as 1. Region 1bp to 100000bp on chromosome 1 is 1:1,100000)
1:1,200000

#Parameter 3:	Minor allele occurance threshhold, representing the minimum number of taxa where the minor allele exist. It is 2 by default.
2

#Parameter 4:	Number of threads (taxa number to be processed at the same time). It is 32 by default.
32

#Parameter 5:	Individual genotype directory

#Parameter 6:	Variation library directory
