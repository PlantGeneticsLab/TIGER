# Toolkits Integrated for Genetic and Evolutionary Research
*Code packages and apps to conduct efficient genetic and evolutionary analysis*

TIGER are integrated toolkits facilitating research analysis on genetics and evolution. It combines efficiency and flexibility to realize high-performance computation of various types of research analysis. TIGER is a java based program, which is divided into two major packages, “infra” and “app”. The package “infra” means infrastructure. The goal is to develop extremely efficient code/class/packages for low-level bioinformatic computation, for example, table, sequence, DNA, alignment, genotype, popgen utilities, bit operation/storage/conversion, hyperthreading IO, self-structured data storage, etc. The package “app” means application. The goal is to develop various flexible and high-level bioinformatic applications, which run on “infra.” It is like apps run on operating systems in iOS and take advantage of the well-designed system. Currently, available apps include SNP calling from whole genome sequencing, genotyping, kmer analysis, RNA-seq profiling, etc. TIGER will be developed in a long-term basis and new apps will be added in.
